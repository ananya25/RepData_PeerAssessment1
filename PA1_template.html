Loading and preprocessing the data
The first step is to load the activity data set into a data frame df
Overview of Data Head(df) and summary(df) provide the first few lines of the dataset and the summary statistics respectively.
 df <- read.csv("/Users/Ananya/Data-Science CE/Reproducible Research/Project/activity.csv", head=TRUE,  na.strings="NA" )
head(df)
##   steps    date interval
## 1    NA 10/1/12        0
## 2    NA 10/1/12        5
## 3    NA 10/1/12       10
## 4    NA 10/1/12       15
## 5    NA 10/1/12       20
## 6    NA 10/1/12       25

Processing of Data
remove the missing values,
change the date column to reflect the date,
subsetting the data set to new dataframe for further analysis
df$date <-as.Date(df$date)
df_missingremoved <-subset(df, !is.na(df$steps))
What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
To solve this problem and to build histogram, we will first use tapply function which is used when a function is to be computed on a dataset (mean) and the results are to be displayed in appropriate form (Histogram in this case)

dailyavg <- tapply(df_missingremoved$steps, df_missingremoved$date, sum, na.rm = TRUE)


hist(x=dailyavg,
     col="green",
     breaks=20,
     xlab="Daily total steps",
     ylab="Frequency",
     main="The distribution of daily total (missing data ignored)")

Mean of total number of steps taken per day
mean(dailyavg)
## [1] 10729.94
Median of total number of steps taken per day
median(dailyavg)
## [1] 10890
What is the average daily activity pattern?
Make a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = “𝚕”) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
avginterval <- tapply(df_missingremoved$steps, df_missingremoved$interval, mean, na.rm=TRUE, simplify=T)
df_avgint <- data.frame(interval=as.integer(names(avginterval)), avg=avginterval)

with(df_avgint,
     plot(interval,
          avg,
          type="l",
          xlab="5-minute intervals",
          ylab="average steps in the interval across all days"))
https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11684000/12294087/b1155b54-b9c5-11e5-8d7c-8233452e8176.png
### Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

max_steps <- max(df_avgint$avg)
df_avgint[df_avgint$avg == max_steps, ]
##     interval      avg
## 835      835 206.1698
Interval 835 has the highest number of steps ## Imputing missing values ### Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s) The number of missing values is calculated by calculating all na rows

sum(is.na(df$steps))
## [1] 2304
Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
Using the mean for the 5 minute interval for filling missing values

Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
df_impute <- df
ndx <- is.na(df_impute$steps)
int_avg <- tapply(df_missingremoved$steps, df_missingremoved$interval, mean, na.rm=TRUE, simplify=T)
df_impute$steps[ndx] <- int_avg[as.character(df_impute$interval[ndx])]
Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
new_dailysum <- tapply(df_impute$steps, df_impute$date, sum, na.rm=TRUE, simplify=T)

hist(x=new_dailysum,
     col="green",
     breaks=20,
     xlab="daily steps",
     ylab="frequency",
     main="The distribution of daily total (with missing data imputed)")
https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11684000/12294089/b11c5a30-b9c5-11e5-89ee-f947398aaf1c.png
Comparing with the previous mean and median from data where mising values where removed. Mean for imputed data is

mean(new_dailysum)
## [1] 10739.01
Median for imputed data is

median(new_dailysum)
## [1] 10766.19
So the mean for the imputed case is 10739.01 and the median is 10766.19. The missing removed values were 10729.94 and 10890. Since the mising values have been substituted by the mean value of the interval, the median is now more closer to the mean in the imputed case ## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends? ### Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

weekday_end<- function(date) {
    day <- weekdays(date)
    if (day %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")) 
        return("weekday") else  return("weekend") 
}
weekday <- sapply(df_impute$date, weekday_end)
df_impute$wk <- as.factor(weekday)
head(df_impute)
##       steps       date interval      wk
## 1 1.7169811 0010-01-12        0 weekday
## 2 0.3396226 0010-01-12        5 weekday
## 3 0.1320755 0010-01-12       10 weekday
## 4 0.1509434 0010-01-12       15 weekday
## 5 0.0754717 0010-01-12       20 weekday
## 6 2.0943396 0010-01-12       25 weekday
Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = “𝚕”) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).
wk_df <- aggregate(steps ~ wk+interval, data=df_impute, FUN=mean)

library(lattice)
xyplot(steps ~ interval | factor(wk),
       layout = c(1, 2),
       xlab="Interval",
       ylab="Number of steps",
       type="l",
       lty=1,
       data=wk_df)
